Corrections on the assignment due Wednesday, September 3, 2014
- Free Response Question 1: if the array is empty, you should return 0
- Free Response Question 2: I wrote "height" when I meant length, you may use either word. Also, you may need more room that what is provided, so feel free to use the backside of the page.
